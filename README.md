# APIQuiz
VTEX internship introductory project

The APIQuiz is a RESTful Web API that can register players, provide them questions, take their answers and classify them in a ranking.
This was done as an introductory project during my Winter Internship @ VTEX.

The Postman Collection for testing is in the root of the project, along with the folders.
